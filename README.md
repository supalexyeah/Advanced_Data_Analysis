# Advanced_Data_Analysis

This is the final project of Advanced_Data_Analysis class. Topics covered in this course include:
* Multivariate linear regression (least-square estimation & normal equations, model building & variable selection)
* Principal component analysis & Factor analysis (Eigen-values and eigenvectors, scree plots, dimension reduction, factor rotation)
* Canonical Correlation (to assess the relationship between two sets of variables)
* Discriminant analysis (Fisher's discriminant function)
* Cluster analysis (similarity measures, hierarchical clustering & non-hierarchical clustering).
* Multidimensional Scaling
